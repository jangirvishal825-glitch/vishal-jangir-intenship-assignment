# **Frontend Engineer Assignment (No Code, High-Quality UI Focus)**

## **Evaluation Criteria**

* Frontend tech selection and reasoning (framework, state, data fetching)
* UI architecture (routing, component design, reusable patterns)
* API calling strategy (error handling, retries, abort, pagination)
* Browser-level caching + offline-friendly patterns
* Debugging + observability (logging, tracing, error boundaries)
* Security basics on client (token handling, safe downloads, XSS considerations)
* UX quality for async jobs (progress, partial results, resilience)

## **Problem 1: Video-to-Notes Platform (Frontend System Design)**

**Goal:** Upload video → job runs async → user sees status + outputs: Summary.md, highlights (timestamps), assets. [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./Video-summary-platform.md)

**Your solution must include**

* **Screens:** Upload, Jobs list, Job detail (status/logs), Results (markdown + highlights)
* **UI states:** loading, queued, processing, success, failed, retry, partial output
* **API calling plan:** how you poll/stream job progress (polling vs SSE), abort on navigation
* **Caching:** what to cache in browser (job list, job detail, results), TTL strategy, invalidation
* **Debugging plan:** how you would debug “stuck processing” from frontend side (network logs, correlation id display)

## **Problem 2: LinkedIn Automation Platform (Frontend System Design)**

**Goal:** Connect LinkedIn → persona setup → draft preview → approve → schedule → posting history. [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./linkedin-automation.md)

**Your solution must include**

* **Screens:** Connect, Persona editor, Drafts (3 variants), Approval, Scheduler, Post history
* **Form UX:** persona inputs validation, topic input rules, guardrails for scheduling
* **API calling:** draft generation request lifecycle, optimistic UI vs strict confirmation
* **Caching:** drafts caching, schedule list caching, refetch triggers after approval/post
* **Debugging:** how you surface posting failures to user and capture details for support

## **Problem 3: DOCX Template → Bulk Generator (Frontend System Design)**

**Goal:** Upload template → review fields → single generate → bulk via CSV → ZIP download + per-row report. [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./docs-template-output-generation.md)

**Your solution must include**

* **Screens:** Template upload, Field review/editor, Single fill form, Bulk upload, Bulk run status, Report table, Downloads
* **Field UI:** field types (text/number/date), required/default, inline validation
* **Bulk UX:** CSV upload constraints, mapping UI (optional), progress + partial success
* **Browser caching:** template metadata caching, field schema caching, bulk report pagination caching
* **Downloads:** safe download UX (signed URL flow assumed), progress indicator

## **Problem 4: Character-Based Video Series Generator (Frontend System Design)**

**Goal:** Define characters once → create episode from story → view episode package (script/scenes/assets/render plan). [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./char-based-video-generation.md)

**Your solution must include**

* **Screens:** Character library, Relationship editor, Episode creator, Episode detail (scenes), Asset gallery
* **Consistency UX:** show “locked character profile” per episode, version badges
* **API calling:** long-running generation job UI (progress, resume)
* **Caching:** character library caching, episode package caching, asset thumbnails caching

## **Cross-Cutting** 

Answer these in **bullet points** (max 1 page total):

1. **Frontend stack choice**

* EDIT YOUR ANSWER HERE: Framework (Next.js/Vue/etc), state management, router, UI kit, why.
  `<EDIT YOUR ANSWER HERE>`

2. **API layer design**

* Fetch/Axios choice, typed client generation (OpenAPI), error normalization, retries, request dedupe, abort controllers.

3. **Browser caching plan**

* What you cache (GET responses, derived state), where (memory, IndexedDB, localStorage), TTL/invalidation rules.
* How you handle “job status updates” without stale UI.
  `
  <EDIT YOUR ANSWER HERE>`

4. **Debugging & observability**

* Error boundaries, client-side logging approach, correlation id propagation, “report a problem” payload.
* How you would debug: slow uploads, failed downloads, intermittent 500s.

5. **Security basics**

* Token storage approach, CSRF considerations (if cookies), XSS avoidance for markdown rendering, safe file download patterns.
